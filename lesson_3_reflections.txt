When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  In order to share projects with other people

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
  If I work on some changes and want my working copy to stay the same until I have finished my changes. Before pushing the changes on to GitHub I have to merge the changes, other people have done in the meantime.
  Push: In order to provide a working version of the project on GitHub. In that way other people, who are part of the team, have always a working version and can contribute.
