- subdirectory .git is created with the information about the repository
- necessary in order to add/commit files
- the working directory is every file on the computer; in the staging area I can see the files, I want to commit
- it is possible to have other files as well in a directory, which should not be added to the repository
- it is possible to check all the changes in the staging area before committing. In that way you can check, if any other changes were done.
- branches are good for new features or if a version is published
- you see in a graphical way the structure of the branches
- result of merging two files is a merged branch or master with the changes of both branches
- automatic merges:
   pros: easy to merge different branches together
   cons: it can happen that conflicts appear (f.e. if same code is changed)
