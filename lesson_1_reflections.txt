- Easy to see the differences between two versions of one file
- If there is a problem between two versions of the program, it's easier to identify the problem
- you can commit, when a feature is finished and have defined commit points
- a feature always consists of changes of a couple of files -> therefore all files should be committed at once
- git log in order to get the history; git diff gets the difference between two commits
- I always can go back to the previous version, which worked
- try to find the problem and check in the bug fix
